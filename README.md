# K-means-clustering
This project implements the K-Means clustering algorithm on a randomly generated dataset with two features. The algorithm is written in Python and visualizes the clustering process using Matplotlib.

## Description

K-Means clustering is a popular unsupervised machine learning algorithm used to partition a dataset into k clusters. The algorithm works iteratively to assign each data point to one of the k clusters based on the features provided. The centroids of the clusters are recalculated in each iteration until convergence.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is randomly generated with two features. A total of 50 data points are created using the `numpy` library.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
